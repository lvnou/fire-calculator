# FIRE-Calculator
This is a financial calculator to determine retirement ages based on preferences. It follows the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) strategy.
There are some tools for this already available online but they did not have a fitting configuration for me - so I decided to write my own. Also, the online tools available are often overly optimistic in their assumptions.

Feel free to play around with the code and adjust to your own preferences.
